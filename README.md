# Plant Disease Prediction

A machine learning project to detect plant diseases using image classification.

---

## Key Features

- **Disease Detection**: Identifies plant diseases from images of leaves.
- **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

---

## Dataset

The project uses the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset). It contains images of healthy and diseased leaves for multiple plant species.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more plant species.
- Implement explainable AI techniques to highlight regions causing predictions.
- Improve model performance with advanced architectures.
